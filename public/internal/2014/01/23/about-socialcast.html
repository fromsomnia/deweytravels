<ul>
<li>
<p>Philips “We used Socialcast’s API to connect with Connect Us, our enterprise social platform. We created a private group for leaders to engage and have dialogues. Upon opening the summit app, the saw the activity stream on which they could create their own messages and engage with other messages. This made it easy for them to connect with other participants and share information, photos and videos. All content on Philips’ Socialcast community was projected onto meeting walls, creating a powerful, visual experience.” http://www.simply-communicate.com/case-studies/company-profile/philips%E2%80%99-leadership-summit-goes-all-digital</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Humana “Using the Socialcast API, a team of Human Resources employees conceptualized and developed a suite of apps and game-like activities with the goal of strengthening the community. Humana’s goal was to make Socialcast – or “Buzz,” as it’s called internally, into an engaging and helpful tool for employees. The team created “The Hive,” a personal social graph for every employee that highlighted one’s participation level and the fellow Buzzers with whom they collaborated the most. They also created apps to highlight unanswered questions, participation heat maps, and trending conversations.” http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/12/how-humana-used-the-socialcast.php</p>
