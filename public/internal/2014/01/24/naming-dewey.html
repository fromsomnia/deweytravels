  <h1>Introducing Dewey <small> - Jan 24, 2014</small></h1>

  <div id="content"><p>After a bunch of brainstorming on names, we finally come up with a name that everyone likes: Dewey!</p>

<p>We decided pretty quickly that we want a person name that represents knowledge - either the collection, the processing, or the organization of knowledge. This is, at its core, the crux of the project that VMWare brought forward to us.</p>

<p>We brainstormed a couple of names, such as Athena, Minerva, Prometheus, Sheldon, Sherlock. Sherlock and Dewey were our final two.</p>

<p>The name Dewey comes from The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), or Dewey Decimal System, is a proprietary library classification system first published in the United States by Melvil Dewey in 1876. This classification system, used in 200,000 libraries in at least 135 countries, is hugely valuable in organizing the vast knowledge held by the libraries. DDCâ€™s goal is quite similar to our own. In large enterprises, knowledge are interspersed in so many places that it is extremely difficult for people to manage and find. We hope that our system, like DDC, can help organize and make sense of this complexity, hence bringing productivity and effective knowledge sharing in the workplace.</p></div>
