  <h1>Team Formation <small> - Jan 21, 2014</small></h1>

  <div id="content"><p>The Dewey Team was formed on Jan 21, 2014 at CS 210 Large Group Meeting.</p>

<p>Members of the team arrive at this project in different ways: Brett and Stephen just got into CS 210 class just hours or days earlier. John, Will and Veni ranked this project highly for different reasons - John for the NLP focus, Veni for the automated Q&amp;A element of it, and Will for the possibility of improving social connections in the workplace. Either way, we are all excited to be working with VMWare in these two quarters!</p>

<p>Right out of the gate, we have to brainstorm things like name, logo, and project idea, as well as developing relationship with our liaisons from VMWare. The most important thing about these early days, however, is perhaps getting to know each other better and setting a good base of our working relationship in the next two quarters.</p></div>
