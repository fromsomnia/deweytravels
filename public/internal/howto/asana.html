  <h1 id="using_asana_effectively">Using Asana Effectively</h1>
<hr />
<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>

<p>Put everything in one place, reduce miscommunication and unclean separation of work. A good use of Asana will lead to less useless emails + less status meetings.</p>

<h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>

<ul>
<li>Projects - big group of tasks, e.g. “Engineering” “Design”</li>

<li>Tags - smaller categorization –&gt; “meeting-agenda-0204”, “fun”</li>

<li>Heading - write a task ending with colon(:)</li>

<li>Followers - like cc’ing in email. You can also follow a project to get updates on that project. At least, put your directors as followers, or people who are doing related work.</li>

<li>Assignee - assigning people to tasks. It makes it easier for you to keep track of your tasks and other people’s tasks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="emails">Emails</h2>

<p>Asana sends 2 types of emails:</p>

<ul>
<li>reminder - daily reminders of your tasks that due today / this week.</li>

<li>activity email - sends you email on updates at tasks you follow (people’s comments, mark-as-complete, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>You shouldn’t turn off the activity email. Reminder email can be noisy and you can turn it off - just make sure you check the Asana web interface often enough not to forget your tasks. These two are opt-out-able. I use filters on my gmail for Asana stuff, probably you’ll want to do it too.</p>

<h2 id="important_tip">Important tip</h2>

<p>You can write a reply to an Asana task by replying an Asana task email. You can also create and modify Asana tasks via email. More details - http://help.asana.com/customer/portal/articles/69313</p>

<h2 id="when_you_should_create_an_asana_task">When you should create an Asana task?</h2>

<p>Good rule of thumb: Anytime you think that other people can benefit from / should know about whatever it is you’re doing. Anytime you want to start a new discussion. Discussion should be put in comments - to make sure our conversation is not cluttered.</p>
