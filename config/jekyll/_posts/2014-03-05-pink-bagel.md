# LinkedIn Ads
--------

LinkedIn Ads is our first stab on this task, because of the professional nature of our product. LinkedIn seems to be a good way to slice by demographics.

The result:
  9,596 impressions
  1 click
  19.19 USD

Demographics:
  US-based Human Resources Employees

Learning:
  the market size is relatively specific and small,
  relevant demographic studies will need much more money

Because of the very low click through rate, we decided to continue with Facebook instead.
