---

Socialcast is an enterprise social platform that connects people to the knowledge, ideas and resources they need to work better together. Socialcast is owned by VMWare, and used by more than 20,000 companies around the world.

The fundamental value of Socialcast is merging many different systems used in business settings, reducing the need to switch between systems to do work. Many companies use different services to do different things, such as uploading files, gauging employee interests / ideas, etc. Each functions in the company often use different tools to do their work.

Example usage of Socialcast’s API:

* Philips
      “We used Socialcast’s API to connect with Connect Us, our enterprise social platform. We created a private group for leaders to engage and have dialogues. Upon opening the summit app, the saw the activity stream on which they could create their own messages and engage with other messages. This made it easy for them to connect with other participants and share information, photos and videos. All content on Philips’ Socialcast community was projected onto meeting walls, creating a powerful, visual experience.” http://www.simply-communicate.com/case-studies/company-profile/philips%E2%80%99-leadership-summit-goes-all-digital

* Humana
    “Using the Socialcast API, a team of Human Resources employees conceptualized and developed a suite of apps and game-like activities with the goal of strengthening the community. Humana’s goal was to make Socialcast – or “Buzz,” as it’s called internally, into an engaging and helpful tool for employees. The team created “The Hive,” a personal social graph for every employee that highlighted one’s participation level and the fellow Buzzers with whom they collaborated the most. They also created apps to highlight unanswered questions, participation heat maps, and trending conversations.”
