title: Presentation to VMware
---


We are in Japan! As part of CS 210 class, the plan is for us to meet Rakuten and VMware Japan to get feedback of our current product and our future roadmap. As fresh sets of eyes and corporate employees with international perspective, their feedback will be really valuable in moving forward. Because William had an Alternative Spring Break in North Dakota, only Veni, Brett, Stephen and John did the presentations in Japan.

VMware Japan is located in a tall building very close to Hamamatsucho Sq, Tokyo. We were immediately greeted by Nagisa, a recruiter that organizes our meeting today. She assembled a panel of 8 people: 3 backend-engineers from End-User-Computing group, 1 technical sales from End-User-Computing group, 2 human resources, a recruiting manager and herself.

After brief introductions of the panel, we gave our presentation. The presentation we gave there can be seen [here:] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_z9wj1wW7dp606LdDfJlhd83JcpfYzyv489z1W8vBHU/edit?usp=drive_web)
