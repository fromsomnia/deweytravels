title: Benchmarking Product Area
---

Enterprise product is a new area for most of us and none of us have previously used Socialcast before. Because of that, we started the benchmarking with the general area of enterprise social network. The full benchmarking document can be seen [here] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uXgTH6dltvE6ecdf8HDoV9y4bhoV6A2Md1Djty_wFeg/edit), and a comparison matrix can be seen [here] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgxIKrJjqiXwdFVBT25JNk5mRkpDbTdDUmlaZjlLdGc&usp=drive_web#gid=0).

Some of the competitors are:

* Quad from Cisco Systems
* Connections from IBM
* Engage from Jive Software
* SharePoint Workspace from Microsoft
* Salesforce Chatter from Salesforce
* StreamWork from SAP
* Yammer from Microsoft

Feature sets of most of these products are similar to real-life social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc), adapted to workplace environment. For example, there are supports for files and teams. In the coming years, there will be more and more customization of these processes to enterprise settings. A PwC paper suggests that the next generation of corporate social network will be focused on semantic analysis to make sense of the plethora of data floating around in the workplace.

We also did a benchmarking on Q & A products, such as Quora, Jelly, Ask.com, and ChaCha. We like the people suggestions on Quora in connecting people to experts and the smart push notification system of Jelly.


After [pivoting] (/internal/2014/02/17/pivoting.html), we looked at expertise mapper / expertise finder that exists on the market. See the full benchmarking document [here] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gZTdLcREtbPWPnqGhci8yzLniOswV3B5lqP-OmzhafA/edit?usp=drive_web).

Key Takings

* The problem ‘find the best person in topic X’ or ‘find the best person to answer question Y’ has been tackled in numerous different ways, catered to different use cases
* Most services here are painful to use and very text-heavy, with lists of never-ending topics to choose from. Approaching this problem visually will differentiate our product.
* Services that attempt automatic mapping restrict the scope to certain types of sources or certain verticals.
* A learning mechanism for the people suggestions (either via likes or votes) is crucial.
