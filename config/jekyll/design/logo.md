# Logo Design Process
--------------
by John Pulvera

## Inspiration

Inspiration for the logo was taken from the previous Dewey logo designed by William which featured the name "Dewey" and three horizontally-aligned dots.  That original design was inspired by the Dewey Decimal System, from which our team name "Dewey" was derived.

## Iteration

Using the previous Dewey logo, I took the three dots we had and connected them to create a graph structure, which is the structure we envisioned our data visualization to display.  For asymmetry, I reduced the sizes of the dots to 100%, 75%, and 50%.  I tried different orientations for connections and angles of connections and settled on a triangular design because it looked nice.  I set the text and placed the image in different locations around the text but settled on the left-hand side.  Finally, I rotated the logo and applied reflections to see what rotation made the image look the best.

## Color and Font

The color was chosen from "brandcolors.net".  Using the popular collections filter, I used Foursquare's blue and Google's white because blue seemed standard amongst apps and another color was needed to balance the blue.  The font Trebuchet was chosen as it was the best-looking font for our name "dewey" amongst the default font options provided by Google Drawing.

## Google Drawing

Google Drawing was used for graphic design and mockups because of its simplicity, cloud and collaboration capabilities, and ability to get the job done.
