# Logo Design Process
--------------


## Inspiration

## Iteration

## Color and Font

I used the three dots we had in our previous logo and connected two of them to one to make a basic graph.  I reduced to sizes to 100%, 75%, and 50% for variation in size.  I connected them to be triangular because I thought it would look cool.  I did different forms of reflections and rotations until I settled on the current logo and text.  For the text, "Trebuchet" was the best looking default option for font-family in Google Drawing.  I used Google drawing for everything because it was simple (does what I need) and cloud-hosted and collaborative.
