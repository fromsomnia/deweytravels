## Mobile-First

## Responsive Web Design

## Flat Design

## Colors and Fonts

## Inspiration

I've read several articles that advocate create mobile-first products and designs.  I also read about responsive web design and thought that this concept (by using media queries to separate css styles at a threshold of 640px; 640px is iphone resolution width) was the most durable way to design for multiple devices.  I used the colors and fonts from the logo and restricted it to those two main colors.  I used a flat design because I prefer those over others (more simple and clean and easier to style in css).  Got inspiration from flat mobile app designs on the internet.  Tried to increase surface-area of buttons and inputs so that it is touch-friendly.  Mobile design is primarily text based but has another "data visualization" view.  Desktop design is a combination of both inspired by Google Maps.  The background will be an interactive data visualization with some UI fixed to the top-left with some margins.
