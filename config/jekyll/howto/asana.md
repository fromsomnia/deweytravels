# Using Asana Effectively
--------------

## Goal
Put everything in one place, reduce miscommunication and unclean separation of work. A good use of Asana will lead to less useless emails + less status meetings.

## Organization
* Projects - big group of tasks, e.g. "Engineering" "Design"
* Tags - smaller categorization --> “meeting-agenda-0204”, “fun”
* Heading - write a task ending with colon(:)
* Followers - like cc'ing in email. You can also follow a project to get updates on that project. At least, put your directors as followers, or people who are doing related work.
* Assignee - assigning people to tasks. It makes it easier for you to keep track of your tasks and other people's tasks.

## Emails
Asana sends 2 types of emails:
* reminder - daily reminders of your tasks that due today / this week.
* activity email - sends you email on updates at tasks you follow (people's comments, mark-as-complete, etc)

You shouldn't turn off the activity email. Reminder email can be noisy and you can turn it off - just make sure you check the Asana web interface often enough not to forget your tasks. These two are opt-out-able. I use filters on my gmail for Asana stuff, probably you'll want to do it too.

## Important tip

You can write a reply to an Asana task by replying an Asana task email. You can also create and modify Asana tasks via email. More details - http://help.asana.com/customer/portal/articles/69313

## When you should create an Asana task?

Good rule of thumb:
Anytime you think that other people can benefit from / should know about whatever it is you're doing.
Anytime you want to start a new discussion. Discussion should be put in comments - to make sure our conversation is not cluttered.
